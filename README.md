A repository dedicated to kata solved with the Go language, as well as various tips and tricks.

For example, the Go test runner will ignore folders called `testdata`, so this name can be used for folders that story ancillary data needed by tests.
Had issues with the test runner multiple times, so nts: If test function has capitalized name but still not detected by the test runner, try renaming it to start with the word "Test".
